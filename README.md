# Victuals
================================================================================

DESCRIPTION:

Victuals is a wine and food pairing web application. 

================================================================================

INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the web application in a internet browser of your choice. Click on the search field and enter a keyword for a recipe. Try "risotto" or "chili" or "tacos". The app will use that keyword to make two different API requests (one to Edaman and the other to Spoonacular). The app will then provide a recipe matching your keyword query and three types or varieties of wine that would pair well with your meal. 

================================================================================

TECH STACK:

Victuals utilizes HTML5, CSS3, Animate.CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
